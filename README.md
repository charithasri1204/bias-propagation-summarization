# bias-propagation-summarization
This project studies how pre-training bias in language models affects text summarization. Using synthetic nationality-based data, we test BART and PEGASUS for hallucinated nationality changes. Results show zero bias in this setting, highlighting the role of real-world data in bias propagation.
